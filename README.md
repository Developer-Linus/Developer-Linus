# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=Developer-Linus&theme=dark)](https://git.io/streak-stats)


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Next.js** and **Tailwindcss**.
## My Background Information
- In the heart of Africa, a young man sits with his laptop in a home. He focuses on identifying challenges facing communities in Africa and thinks how using technology like software engineering can help address these challenges. The young man is me, Linus Kipkemoi Langat. I believe that software engineering has a great untapped potential to solving most of the modern challenges given the opportunity that most of us right now have access to internet. Before I explain much about how I can use software engineering to address societal issues, let me tell you something you might not know about me. My background is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I enjoy doing maths and physics and coming out with designs that resonates with user needs. I transitioned to software engineering a year ago. I'm still in the learning journey and with the knowledge I've now, I am really loving the field. I'm now building solutions to address issues that have persisted for long that softwares systems can address. Users are the center of every application and their voice matters. Building a software behind closed doors without involving users is developing a software that will fail before it even reaches its intended users. 

## Who I Am
- I am Linus Kipkemoi Langat, an aspiring software developer passionate about transforming ideas into impactful solutions.
- I continuously learn software development concepts to achieve my mission of building systems that address user pain points and create memorable experiences.

## What Drives Me
- I find fulfillment in developing intuitive, user-friendly software that simplifies lives and solves real-world challenges.
- I believe that individuals and businesses deserve tailored solutions to thrive in our fast-evolving world.
- My goal is to contribute to a satisfied and productive ecosystem, enhancing the quality of life for all.

## My Passion for Problem-Solving:
- I view problems as opportunitiesâ€”the gap between where we are and where we want to be.
- I enjoy the process of finding solutions, both personally and professionally.
- By applying coding and programming, I transform challenges into scalable and effective solutions.

## What I Offer:
- A problem-solving mindset fueled by creativity and persistence.
- A dedication to delivering solutions that resonate with user needs and add value.
- A commitment to continuous learning and growth to stay ahead in the software development field.
